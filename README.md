A scientific, non-diagnostic self-assessment tool to evaluate your readiness for a PhD program.

## üìï Introduction

Pursuing a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) is a significant life decision that involves substantial investment in time, effort, and resources. It is a process filled with academic challenges, research pressures, and personal growth. Therefore, conducting a thorough self-assessment before embarking on this journey is crucial. Many prospective students may be unsure if they possess the necessary motivation, research skills, psychological resilience, and other key competencies required for doctoral studies. This ambiguity can lead to hesitation in decision-making or difficulties in adaptation after enrollment.

The Doctoral Suitability Assessment Scale (DSAS) is a scientific, non-diagnostic self-assessment tool designed to help prospective doctoral students comprehensively evaluate their readiness for pursuing a PhD. Through a series of multi-dimensional questions, this tool assists users in gaining a deeper understanding of their strengths and areas for improvement, providing a valuable reference for their decision-making.
